"""Summary of Findings:
Microsoft:
Total Revenue increased significantly from 2022 to 2023, reflecting a strong year-over-year performance.

Net Income saw a steady growth trend in 2024, with a substantial 15% increase from 2023.

Total Assets and Liabilities both showed an upward trend, but liabilities have grown at a faster rate, indicating potential risks in leveraging.

Cash Flow from Operating Activities grew by 25%, reflecting a strong operational performance.

Tesla:
Teslaâ€™s Revenue Growth was relatively consistent, with small fluctuations, yet still increasing year-over-year.

Net Income Growth was strong in 2023 but dropped significantly in 2024. Further investigation into costs and margins may be necessary.

Total Assets and Total Liabilities grew, but liabilities remain at a manageable level.
